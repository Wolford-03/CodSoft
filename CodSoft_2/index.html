            <h3>Brick-Breaker Game</h3>
            <p>Brick Breaker is a classic arcade game that challenges players to break a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle. The objective is to clear all the bricks from the screen without letting the ball fall off the bottom edge of the playing field. Players control the paddle horizontally at the bottom of the screen, using it to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play to hit and destroy bricks. As bricks are destroyed, players earn points, and some bricks may release power-ups that enhance the paddle or gameplay dynamics.</p>

            <h3>Simon Says</h3>
            <p>Simon Says is a classic memory game that tests players' ability to remember and repeat increasingly longer sequences of colors and sounds. The game features a circular console with four colored sections: red, green, blue, and yellow. Simon, the electronic device or game interface, plays a sequence of tones and lights on these sections in a random order, which players must then repeat by pressing the corresponding colored sections in the correct sequence. As players successfully replicate each sequence, Simon adds another step, making the sequence progressively longer and more challenging.</p>
